Video Chat WebApp Using WEBRTC and NodeJs
Microsoft Engage 2021 Challenge MSTeams Clone



Video Calling WebApp using Nodejs ,WebRTC


Setting up the server
When user lands on home route it is redirected to a unique url generated by uuid and then rendering an html page using EJS templating.(redirected to room.ejs)
Adding the userâ€™s video on the page(video appended to the videogrid element)
Require socket.io and peerjs for peer(user to user) communication
Websockets allow bidirectional communication between server and the user
Peerjs  takes all the webrtc information of the user and turns it to an id which can be passed in different places to connect to peer network and when we connect to peer server and get an id
when someone connects to the webpage ,the events are listened to:when someone joins the same rooms 
when new user joins our room we allow our video and audio stream to be shared with the other users by calling the user and sending our video and audio stream and taking the user video stream and adding to ours pages
when someone calls ,we answer back giving our video stream and responding to the stream sent by them
The send button in chat box sends the value in the input elements to the server and then it is broadcasted to all the users in the same room and is appended to the list items of ul.
Share link option provides the link to the room and allows new users to join the call by using the url ,it allows the user to copy the link to the clipboard and share with the other users.
Authentication of the user(name and password using mongodb Atlas)
